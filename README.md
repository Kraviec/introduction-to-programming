introduction-to-programming
===========================

Please only use this as an example or a place to look for ideas. 
Simply copying the code is the fastest way to fail the course and learn nothing.
I will try to write the programs in the most readable way, maybe even in multiple
programming languages, so you can learn them along with me.
Hope this helps you.
